# TweakInjector_delay

Fix a bug that some app (Gogoro) would crash after using TweakInject of Electra


### Known Issue
This may breaks applist preference loader (or because it breaks rocketbootstrap? not sure). But if you swap the file after jailbreaking with original TweakInject.dylib, it would be ok.
